This project works on using Local Storage. Users will input a set of student data that is then pushed to local storage, and then displayed. In this instance, it mimicks an IU student roster. Students cannot be removed, but they can be added, and will automatically shown once added. Should anything break, there is a "refresh student roster" button. I made sure that the inputs could not be left blank when submitting student data as well.
